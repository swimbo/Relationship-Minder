# Relationship-Minder
Web application to help people maintain stronger relationships using sorting and reminders

## How it works:
The user walks through three simple set up steps that consist of connecting their email account, bucketing their contacts based on desired frequency of contact, and then setting up notification by bucket. They are then shown a feed of all contacts who are 'overdue' for contact based on the date of last contact.

### Technologies used: HTML / CSS / Javascript

#### Frameworks used: Angular.js, Bootstrap, Angular UI Router

#### Libraries/Dependencies: jQuery, datejs, ngAnimate

## Development process:

## User Stories
* As a user I want to connect my email account and import my existing contacts so that I don't have to manually add them.
* As a user I want to place my contacts into pre-established buckets based on how frequently I want to contact them.
* As a user I want to see which of my contacts are overdue.

## Not-Yet-Implemented
* As a user I want to be able to receive notifications via SMS.
* As a user I want to be able to override the typical bucket-level notification preferences for VIP in my list.

## Future implementations
* As a user I want to be able to receive notifications via my phone's built in/native notifications.
* As a user I want the app to automatically update the last contacted date when I make a phone call.
* As a user I want the app to automatically update the last contacted date when I send them an email.
* As a user I want the app to automatically update the last contacted date when I send them an SMS and/or iMessage.
* As a user I want to be able to add an outlook account.
* As a user I want the notifications to be color coded so that I can quickly action the red ones.
* As a user I want the latter pages to be better styled (i.e. not just white).
* As the owner I want the user to be limited to 10 users before they're prompted to buy or share.
* As the owner I want the user to be able to bucket 1 more contact for every 1 person they share it with
* As the user I want my contacts to be shown on the buckets page based on the frequency of how often I have contacted them historically
* As a user I want to set up templates so I can quickly send them a message without a typing on my phone.
* As a user I want the app to be able to add "labels" to a contact so I know what is important to them (e.g. marketing, coding, biotech)
* As a user I want the app to search my news feed (or a generic news feed if I don't have one) and suggest applicable articles to send a given contact.
