# Relationship-Minder
Web application to help people maintain stronger relationships using sorting and reminders

## How it works:
The user walks through three simple set up steps that consist of connecting their email account, bucketing their contacts based on desired frequency of contact, and then setting up notification by bucket. They are then shown a feed of all contacts who are 'overdue' for contact based on the date of last contact.

### Technologies used: HTML / CSS / Javascript

#### Frameworks used: Angular.js, Bootstrap, Angular UI Router

#### Libraries/Dependencies: jQuery, datejs, ngAnimate

## Development process:

## User Stories
As a user I want to connect my email account and import my existing contacts so that I don't have to manually add them.
As a user I want to place my contacts into pre-established buckets based on how frequently I want to contact them.
As a user I want to see which of my contacts are overdue.

## Not-Yet-Implemented
As a user I want to be able to receive notifications via SMS.
As a user I want to be able to override the typical bucket-level notification preferences for VIP in my list.

## Future implementations
As a user I want to be able to receive notifications via my phone's built in/native notifications.
As a user I want the app to automatically update the last contacted date when I make a phone call.
As a user I want the app to automatically update the last contacted date when I send them an email.
